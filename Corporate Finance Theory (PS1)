\section*{Problem 1}
  Tax  shields  and  equity  value  (10  p.):  Assume  an  MM  world  with  corporate 
taxes  (at  a  rate  $T_c$)  but  no  personal  taxes.  Assume  a  risk-free  interest  rate  of  R. 
Assume that the firm’s cash flow is a risk- less perpetuity that yields cash flow X 
next  period,  $X(1+g)$  next  period,  $X(1+g)^2$ in  two  periods,  etc.  with  perfect 
certainty,  where R  $>$ g  $>$ 0.  Assume  that  debt  contracts  have  constant  interest 
payments  of  i*D  (where  i  is  the  coupon  rate  and  D  is  the  face  value,  both  are 
exogenously given constants) and infinite maturity. (Hint: The firm may issue new 
debt at each date) 
The  following  questions  are  designed  to  understand  this  important  question:  We 
know  in  MM  with  only  corporate  tax,  debt  financing  strictly  dominates  equity 
financing. Does this necessarily imply that the firm’s leverage ratio (market value 
of Debt divided by total value, V = E + D) equals one? 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] What is the optimal (dynamic) capital structure policy of this firm? 
    \item[b.] What is the value V of the levered firm? 
    \item[c.] What is the value of the tax shield? 
    \item[d.] What is the leverage ratio D/V of this firm today? What is the value of 
equity? 
    \item[e.] Does this exercise give any insights or implications for empirical tests of 
the static trade-off theory?
\end{enumerate}
 
\section*{Problem 2}

Irrelevance of total payout policy under M\&M (10 p.): Consider a two period 
model. At t=0 the firm has cash of C dollars. The firm has an investment 
opportunity,  which  involves  investing  I  dollars  into  a  project  at  t=0,  which  will 
yield a random cash flow of X dollars at t=1. If less than I is invested, cash flows 
are  zero,  and  if  more  is  invested,  cash  flows  is  still  only  X.  The  cost  of  capital 
(i.e. the  investors’ required  rate of  return  on  the all-equity financed  firm) for the 
project is $r_A$ and the risk-free borrowing and lending rate is $r_F$. At time t=1, the 
firm pays out whatever cash is available to its investors. At time t=0, the firm has 
the  option  to  pay  a  dividend  to  investors  of  D.  Assume,  for  simplicity,  that  any excess cash the firm does not use at t=0 (i.e. that is not invested in the project or 
paid out as a dividend) is invested in a risk-free bond. Show that under the M\&M 
assumptions, the size of the dividend D is irrelevant for the value of the firm (i.e. 
irrelevant to the investors in the firm). Hint: Start with defining the firm’s budget 
constraint D – R = C – I* – B, where R is the amount of cash raised from investors 
at t=0, B is the amount of cash that the firm invests in risk-free securities at t=0, 
and I* is the firm’s optimal investment in the project. 
 
\section*{Problem 3}
Why new equity of financially distressed firms is issued at a discount (10 p.): 
Consider a firm that has debt outstanding with a face value of \$80 and 10  shares 
of  stock.  There’s  a  50\%  chance  the  firm  will  be  worth  \$100,  and  a  50\%  chance the firm will be worth \$20. The firm has an investment that requires \$15 up front, 
but  will  pay  off  \$20  for  sure.  The  firm  wants  to  issue  equity  to  finance  the 
investment. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] What is the stock trading  at  right  before  the  equity  issue  is  announced? Assume  that  the  market  at  this  point  does  not  know  about  the  investment opportunity. 
    \item[b.] At what price per share will the equity issue have to take place, in order to raise  the  financing  for  the  new  investment  (assume  the  firm  announces investment  opportunity  at  the  time  equity  issuance)?  At  what  price  will the  stock trade after the investment has been made? 
\end{enumerate}

 
\section*{Problem 4}
Debt, cash, and investment distortions (12p.): Consider a firm  with  two 
mutually exclusive investment opportunities. Both investment projects require an 
investment of I = 15 and generate the following cash flows next period: 

  \begin{table}[h]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|C{3cm}|C{3cm}|}
            \hline
              State & Probability & Cash flow from project 1 = $X_1$ & Cash flow from project 2 = $X_2$ \\
              \hline
              1 & 1/3  & 20 &0 \\
              2 & 1/3  & 20 &0\\
              3 & 1/3  & 20 &30\\
              \hline
            \end{tabular}
\end{table}\leavevmode\\
The firm has current cash of Y, as well as debt outstanding with a face value of F that is due next period. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.] Assume that a seniority covenant prohibits the issue of additional debt, and 
that renegotiation of the debt is not possible. Show what investment 
decision  shareholders  will  make  in  each  of  the  following  cases  (i)  through 
(vii), below. Calculate firm, equity, and debt values in each case. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[i.] The firm is unlevered (F=0) and has cash available of Y=15. 
    \item[ii.] F = 5 and Y=15 
    \item[iii.] F = 15 and Y=15 
    \item[iv.] F = 18 and Y=15 
    \item[v.] F = 5 and Y=0 
    \item[vi.] F = 15 and Y=8 
    \item[vii.] F = 18 and Y=12 
\end{enumerate}
\item[b.] Can you draw some simple empirical predictions from these cases? Under 
which circumstances would we expect over- vs. under-investment 
problems to be present? 
\item[c.] Now assume that there is no covenant against issuing pari-passu debt. In 
which cases will the firm be strictly better off without this covenant? 
\item[d.] Assume again that seniority covenants prohibit the issue of additional debt. 
But before the investment (and raising I=15) occurs, suppose that 
shareholders can give a take-it or leave-it offer to bondholders to exchange 
their  debt  for  some  share  of  equity  in  the  firm.  In  which  cases  would  this 
change the investment outcome, and how? 
\item[e.] What do you learn from above results found in (c) and (d)?
\end{enumerate}
